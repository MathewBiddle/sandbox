Cetacean Sanctuary Research   is  conducted  on  board  the research  vessel  “Pelagos”  a  21-meter motorsailer,   that cruises around the Ligurian Sea  between  Italy,  France  and  Corsica  from  May  to  October,  departing  weekly  from  Sanremo,  Italy.  The  Ligurian  Sea  presents  both  a  deep-water  and  a  shelf-slope  habitat,   suitable  for  the  breeding  and  foraging  needs  of  eight  commonly  occurring  cetacean  species.  It  has  one  of  the  highest concentrations of whales and dolphins in the Mediterranean.  The  study  area  covers  about  25,000  km2  between  Genoa,  Porquerolles  islands,  and  Cape  Corse on the island of Corsica.  The summer surveys are conducted from May to September.   Cetaceans' survey is conducted both visually, by dedicated observers and  acoustically,  by using  a  300 m towed  hydrophone array. Once spotted, cetaceans are approached and followed respecting a code of conduct that minimize the disturbance to the animals. Geographic position, group size, group composition and environmental data are always recorded, together with other variables. Every  thirty  minutes,  while  searching  for  cetaceans,  a  “sampling  station”  is  performed  by  recording  navigation  data  (position,  speed,  course),  environmental  data  (sea  state,  weather, visibility)  and  qualitative  acoustic  data  (acoustic  pollution  and  cetacean  vocalizations),  on a dedicated software. Human activities are also monitored (counting the number and type of boats, ships and fishing activities. The presence of other marine animals is also reported: sea turtles, tunas, swordfish, sunfish, giant devil rays (Mediterranean manta rays), other fish schools and  sea  birds  are  often  among  the  various  sea  life  recorded.  Once  detected, cetaceans (especially sperm whales) are tracked using a dedicated acoustic software.  Photo-identification data are also collected. By taking pictures of particular morphological characteristics, like the trailing edge of dorsal fins or flukes, or the scars on their body, researchers may identify specific individuals. A photo-ID based monitoring system provides crucial information on cetacean distribution, habitat use, population estimate, social structure, seasonal presence, movements and association patterns. The collection of faeces samples is occasionally  performed  from  the  water  surface, in  order to investigate  feeding  habits  of  certain  species.",Yes,"Marine mammals data collection training programs on the field visual and acoustic data collection, photo-identification, behavioral sampling, fecal sampling and methods for conducting population studies.",Option 1: Use the point/polygon tool provided on the next page of the survey to draw your sampling sites/locations (recommended for sampling programs without a csv file or programs with less than 10 sites),"The  study  area is located in the NW Mediterranean Sea and covers  about  25,000  km2  between  Genoa,  Porquerolles  islands,  and  Cape  Corse on the island of Corsica.

Ligurian  Sea  presents  both  a  deep-water  and  a  shelf-slope  habitat,   suitable  for  the  breeding  and  foraging  needs  of  eight  commonly  occurring  cetacean  species.  It  has  one  of  the  highest concentrations of whales and dolphins in the Mediterranean. The shallow waters of the continental shelf (0 to 200 m deep) are the preferred habitat of the common bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus). Deep divers inhabit the continental slope,  (i.e. from  200  to  2000  m).  This  is  the  preferred habitat of sperm whales (Physeter macrocephalus), Risso's dolphins (Grampus griseus) and  Cuvier's  beaked  whales  (Ziphius  cavirostris).  Striped  dolphins  (Stenella  coeruleoalba) are also present in the area. The  pelagic  area  is  defined  as  the open-water  area  where  depth  exceeds  2000  m.  This  is  the  main habitat of fin whales (Balaenoptera physalus), and long-finned pilot whales (Globicephala melas).","{   ""type"": ""FeatureCollection"",   ""features"": [     {       ""type"": ""Feature"",       ""properties"": {},       ""geometry"": {         ""type"": ""Polygon"",         ""coordinates"": [           [             [               6.6357421875,               43.16512263158296             ],             [               7.218017578125001,               43.197167282501276             ],             [               7.794799804687499,               42.96044267380142             ],             [               8.6956787109375,               42.52069952914966             ],             [               8.690185546875,               42.58544425738491             ],             [               8.7451171875,               42.56926437219384             ],             [               8.800048828125,               42.56926437219384             ],             [               8.800048828125,               42.59757641618889             ],             [               8.9044189453125,               42.62587560259137             ],             [               9.0362548828125,               42.65012181368022             ],             [               9.0692138671875,               42.70262285884388             ],             [               9.16259765625,               42.75104599038353             ],             [               8.5858154296875,               43.33316939281732             ],             [               8.4375,               44.19402066387343             ],             [               8.3770751953125,               44.174324837518895             ],             [               8.2562255859375,               44.1151978766043             ],             [               8.2012939453125,               43.97305156068593             ],             [               8.1298828125,               43.91768033000405             ],             [               8.0145263671875,               43.8503744993026             ],             [               7.8057861328125,               43.830564195198264             ],             [               7.6190185546875,               43.77109381775651             ],             [               7.5421142578125,               43.77109381775651             ],             [               7.404785156249999,               43.70362249839005             ],             [               7.27294921875,               43.67581809328341             ],             [               7.239990234375,               43.64800079902171             ],             [               7.163085937499999,               43.64005063334696             ],             [               7.124633789062499,               43.5326204268101             ],             [               6.9708251953125,               43.5326204268101             ],             [               6.96533203125,               43.48481212891603             ],             [               6.882934570312499,               43.41701888881103             ],             [               6.7510986328125,               43.40504748787035             ],             [               6.646728515625,               43.27720532212024             ],             [               6.701660156249999,               43.27720532212024             ],             [               6.6796875,               43.23319741022136             ],             [               6.6357421875,               43.16512263158296             ]           ]         ]       }     }   ] }",1990,active,"With a long-term data set of 30 years, Cetaceans Sanctuary Research Project present on of the most important and long time series of cetaceans data in the Mediterranean Sea.",Daily,Data are collected daily in the summer season (from May to September).,Yes,,"Yes, there are restrictions to raw data access.","http://seamap.env.duke.edu/search/?dataset_id=774,776",http://www.intercet.it/,,Access by request only- anyone can get access but need to formally ask,,Data are subjected to OBIS SEAMAP data sharing policy and INTERCET  data sharing policies.

A key uncertainty is how the marine ecosystem will respond to these shifts in the timing of spring sea ice retreat and/or delays in fall sea ice formation. Variations in upper-ocean water hydrography, stratification, light penetration, planktonic and benthic production, pelagic-benthic coupling, and upper trophic level migration patterns are all influenced by sea ice and temperature changes. In order to evaluate these responses, the Distributed Biological Observatory (DBO) was initiated in 2010 as a change detection array for the identification and consistent monitoring of biophysical responses to environmental change in the Arctic (Moore and Grebmeier 2018, Arctic 71; Grebmeier et al. 2019, Deep Sea Res II 162). Repeat sampling each year is undertaken through multiple international occupations of transect lines and bounding boxes via oceanographic research cruises. Continuous data collections are also obtained annually through mooring and satellite observations. Shared data and periodic data workshops allow evaluation of data sets and collaborative discussions. The Pacific DBO activities focus on 5 regional biological transects located at biological hotspots along a latitudinal gradient in the northern Bering and Chukchi seas. Three additional locations were designated in the Beaufort Sea in 2015, with expansion plans including DBO sites in the Baffin Bay/Davis Strait region, the Atlantic sector of the northern Barents Sea, and possibly into the Russian Arctic.  Spatial and temporal time series, ecosystem-level observations provide increased understanding of the phenology of sea ice growth and retreat, hydrographic characteristics, seasonal plankton development, carbon export and pelagic-benthic coupling, benthic population change, and connection of prey to upper trophic level predators. Development of the DBO is proving to be a significant resource for the identification and consistent monitoring of biophysical responses in the changing Arctic for decision makers and the general public.",Yes,"Since the original development of the 5 transect lines in the Pacific Arctic in 2010 the DBO network has expanded into the US and Canadian Beaufort Seas for time series data collections. In addition, an Atlantic DBO in the Barents Sea is under development with international collaborators as is placed of DBO lines in the Davis Strait/Baffin Bay region between Canada and Greenland.

EcoMon uses a random-stratified design based on the Northeast Fisheries Science Center bottom trawl survey design. The number of plankton strata (n = 47) is lower than the bottom trawl survey (n = 108) as the narrow inshore stratum and the offshore shelf-break stratum of the bottom trawl survey were combined in the EcoMon plankton sampling design. The area encompassed by each stratum determined the number of samples in that stratum.  Plankton samples are collected both day and night using a 61-cm bongo net. Net tow speed is approximately 1.5 knots. Double oblique tows are a minimum of 5-minutes in duration, and fished from the surface to within 5-m of the seabed or to a maximum depth of 200-m. The volume filtered of all collections is measured with mechanical flowmeters mounted across the mouth of each net.  A Conductivity, Temperature, and Depth (CTD) instrument can is paired with the bongo net to collect data concurrently to the plankton sampling. We also sample with CTDs at fixed stations to collect water samples with a Rosette sampler. Samples are analyzed for carbonate water chemistry and nutrient levels from from different water depths.","{   ""type"": ""FeatureCollection"",   ""features"": [     {       ""type"": ""Feature"",       ""properties"": {},       ""geometry"": {         ""type"": ""Polygon"",         ""coordinates"": [           [             [               -66.8408203125,               44.77793589631623             ],             [               -69.12597656249999,               43.89789239125797             ],             [               -70.5322265625,               43.51668853502906             ],             [               -70.751953125,               42.90816007196054             ],             [               -71.05957031249999,               42.4234565179383             ],             [               -70.48828125,               41.80407814427234             ],             [               -71.103515625,               41.44272637767212             ],             [               -71.89453125,               41.07935114946899             ],             [               -73.30078125,               40.51379915504413             ],             [               -74.3994140625,               39.9434364619742             ],             [               -74.619140625,               38.95940879245423             ],             [               -75.2783203125,               37.92686760148135             ],             [               -76.11328125,               36.63316209558658             ],             [               -75.4541015625,               35.567980458012094             ],             [               -75.234375,               35.209721645221386             ],             [               -70.751953125,               37.96152331396614             ],             [               -68.90625,               39.57182223734374             ],             [               -67.060546875,               40.64730356252251             ],             [               -65.56640625,               41.80407814427234             ],             [               -65.91796875,               43.004647127794435             ],             [               -66.1376953125,               43.58039085560784             ],             [               -66.533203125,               44.24519901522129             ],             [               -66.8408203125,               44.77793589631623             ]           ]         ]       }     }   ] }",1971,active,,Quarterly (4x per year),,Yes,,"Yes, there are restrictions to raw data access.",https://accession.nodc.noaa.gov/0187513,,,,,,,,,Yes,OBIS,Yes;

The transect lines sample usually quarterly, though the Gulf of Alaska line coming out of Seward is done 4 times a year between May and September.  The polygon shape in the Chukchi Sea is the area in which a marine mammal detection glider operates annually (since 2013).
